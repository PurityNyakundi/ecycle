# E-Cycle
August 2021
Introduction
E-Cycle are a new company to the market and they are looking to enter the electric cycles market which is growing with popularity. An e-cycle is a typically conventional cycle with a battery and a motor, which takes some of the effort out of cycling and does help with those hills! You might want an E-cycle to help assistance with pedalling or it can help make the commute to work much easier. E-cycle are an online store only based in Kenya and they are able to source and provide the best deals to customers in the market place.

E-Cycle currently have a very basic static website and are looking for a new state of the art dynamic website to attract new customers. The dynamic website should include content that changes as the requirements of the user, eg you, should have a space on the home page which includes responsible/adaptive landing page. It should offer a fluid layout and should allow the website to be responsive for reading and navigation on different devices. It should have fade in/out between the pages.

A database will need to be created to allow customers to create their own personal account. The system will store personal details of each customer, their email address, their date of birth, postal address including postcode, cycle bought, date of sale and amount of sale. Customers who have not registered to renew their details every 12 months should be deleted from the database.

A web enabled application needs to be created to allow users to create, query, browse and manipulate the database and allow the user to create and delete records they are currently browsing.

The website should include search engine optimisation and include a responsive landing page (which includes compelling headline, eye-catching images and at least two testimonials from satisfied customers). It should also include call to action buttons which allow users to sign-up for updates and to shop. These should be appropriately included on the landing pages. These buttons should be eye catching and should offer the customer a 15% off their first order for signing up.

Customers need to create their own account to log into the system via a registration script.
Once they log in they should be presented with an interface that allows them to:
• View their account
• Update their information
• Change their password
You are expected to use a combination of PHP, MySQL and JavaScript to create this application. Your application should also make use of a web service to show the purchases that have been made.

## Task 1 – 25 Marks
Create a landing page for the E-Cycle website which includes the following elements:
• Compelling headline
• Eye-catching images
• Testimonials from satisfied customers
• At least two call to action buttons (sign-up and shop)
• An offer of 15% off first order as a pop up for signing up when the customer hovers over the sign-up action button

## Task 2 – 20 Marks
Create the login and registration system. This should include username and password and store personal details of each customer, their email address, their date of birth, postal address including postcode, cycle bought, date of sale and amount of sale. To gain the highest marks for this task you should make the system as robust as possible and it should allow reset after TEN (10) minutes. It should limit the user to THREE (3) attempts at a login and it should check that the username is not already in use and that the password is checked against the stored password.

## Task 3 – 10 Marks
Once the visitors have logged on they should have access to their account. Create an online contact us form where customers can ask questions directly to E-Cycle. When the user submits the form, it should provide “set” FAQ answers back to the customer before a final submission of the form is permitted, displaying the FAQ page before the customer can submit the form. Remember to include a call to action button.

## Task 4 – 20 Marks
The owners have asked for additional functionality for the website. Implement the following features:
• Mobile accessible website on phone/tablet
• Use of an appropriate web service to meet the client brief
• Responsive/adaptive pages based on user needs
• Personalising the content by adding the city name to the landing page header as a personal touch

## Task 5 – 10 Marks
Ensure that front end users have the ability to create, manipulate and query records that they are currently browsing.

## Task 6 – 15 Marks
You are required to write a FIVE HUNDRED (500) word reflection on this activity. Answer the following questions:
1. What have you learnt?
2. How could the system be improved or further developed to become a fully mobile website?
3. Which parts of the development did you find most difficult and why was this?
4. Why have you chosen responsive over adaptive layout or adaptive layout over responsive and what are the advantages/disadvantages of these different approaches.
5. How did you overcome these difficulties?
Submission requirements
• For each task, you should present the necessary code and screen dumps in a word-processed document.
• All references and citations must use the Harvard Style.
